# EduSnake

Welcome to EduSnake, A fun game in which the player moves a snake to spell out words and calculate by collecting letters on the game board. As the snake eats the letters the words will appear within its body, and it will grow longer and longer. Be careful not to hit the walls or your own body, or you will lose the game.

Our initial goal with this game was to help children and other language learners learn how to spell and calculate through a fun and engaging way, by playing the classic game snake. Over the course of developing the game, we started expanding our horizons and experimenting with new ideas which brought us a separate game mode where players can play against each other. As well as including music in the background and having various difficulty options. The game is fit for people of all ages.

For you to play this game, it is required that you have a computer that can run Java openjdk-19 and an IDE, we recommend using IntelliJ as an IDE.
